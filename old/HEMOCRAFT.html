                    is an educational Minecraft mod directed towards children with hemophilia and children interested in learning about hemophilia. This mod was built in partnership with Pfizer, the Entrepreneurial Game Studio, the National Hemophilia Foundation, and members of the hemophilia community to be used as a tool to teach kids the importance of staying prepared and sticking to their treatment plan.

                    In HEMOCRAFT players learn how to craft an infusion kit and how they can self-infuse with the kit to stay prepared for adventure. While adventuring, they can visit doctors and nurses within the game to learn about resources that can be used along the way. Players are also encouraged to share game strategies with their friends and family to help them understand what it is like to manage hemophilia.

                <p><b>Project Role:</b>  Game Designer/Artist</p>

                    <b>Responsibilities:</b> <br>
                    After I got hired for this project, I volunteered to simultaneously use it as part of an independent study for self-directed research on a child-centered design methodology. For this study I developed a methodology for collecting data based around child-centered design, met with targeted users to document responses, and interpreted the results to apply them to the design decisions made for HEMOCRAFT.

                <p>
                    In addition to conducting research, I coordinated with a cross-functional team to brainstorm and direct design decisions regarding gameplay, narrative, and visuals. I performed as the teamâ€™s sole artist and produced a series of Minecraft-esque textures for custom in-game objects, UI elements, and characters. I also designed the world of HEMOCRAFT utilizing Minecraft modding tools and made necessary adjustments to level design based on feedback gained during my research to enhance user experience.
