                    Pyramid players must test their knowledge brick-by-brick to work their way up a pyramid that is brimming with questions waiting to the answered. 
                    The questions get harder the higher they go and once they reach the top, they have the opportunity to unlock a special all-or-nothing question to challenge their confidence.

                        <b>Responsibilities:</b> <br> My work for Pyramid was part of an internal E-learning games revamp initiative for UNIFY GameLab. The goal was to update the visual aesthetics, ensure responsive design compatibility for various layouts, and extend support for mobile gaming across several game-based products. I took the lead on the Pyramid revamp, assuming full responsibility for its redesign. This process involved close collaboration with the original developers to pinpoint areas requiring enhancements. I developed a series of mock-ups that not only introduced new mobile functionalities but also revealed a more contemporary and polished look. Upon finalizing the designs, I partnered with the programming team to produce and supply the necessary assets for their integration.
