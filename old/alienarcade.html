                <p><b class="emphasis">Alien Arcade</b> 
                    is a game consisting of a series of fast-paced, arcade-style micro games that were designed to be played on the Drexel Ride—a theme park-style motion platform system used for emulating a motion-simulated environment.  Players pair-up and enter the ride to take on the Alien Arcade as two captive humans. While the ride is in motion, those who are waiting outside can volunteer to participate in the game as aliens. To successfully escape from the Alien Arcade, the humans must compete against the alien audience outside of the ride and win enough challenges to overtake the aliens in a tug-of-war style points battle.

                    <b>Responsibilities:</b> <br>
                    While working on Alien Arcade I collaborated with a 9 person team as the project’s Lead Designer and directed the creative direction and game design through detailed mock-ups and concept art. I supervised multiple playtesting sessions to gather data that I integrated into Alien Arcade to help shape the optimum experience for players. Not only did a lead the design team, but I also aided the development of 2D assets and textures for 3D environments and characters. I was also responsible for designing and composing the UI elements and screen layouts.
