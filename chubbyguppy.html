                    is a fun size-based maze navigation puzzle game where you help guide Gil, the bravest guppy under the sea, through adventure ridden caverns by leading him on by dropping food. Hazards aren’t the only thing you need to keep in mind, for every time Gil gets a snack he grows a little larger than before! Even though Gil knows how to throw his weight around to get around pesky obstacles, in this game you must be resourceful with Gil’s Guppy Snacks to avoid a guppy too chubby to escape the caverns!

                    Immediately after co-founding Aquarius Games I took on the role of Design Lead and led the creative direction of Chubby Guppy as part of a 4-person team. I was responsible for drafting the initial concept for Chubby Guppy and managed the original documentation for the project. I helped shape the colorful world of Chubby Guppy through concept art and thorough mock-ups. Additionally, I aided playtesting data collection and utilized user feedback to determine what changes were necessary to improve gameplay and deliver an optimized player experience.

                    During production I was responsible for producing a majority of the in-game art assets. All assets were vector based and made using Adobe Illustrator. In addition to constructing assets, I also handled all animation work needed for both in-game and promotional use.

                        Chubby Guppy was developed utilizing resources from the Entrepreneurial Game Studio (EGS). As part of our partnership with EGS, I was responsible for representing Chubby Guppy and Aquarius games through reoccurring status meetings, pitch competitions, game showcases, and presentations.
