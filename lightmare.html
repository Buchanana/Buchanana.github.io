                        takes place during the heat death of the universe. Nearly all that exists has vanished into an unimaginable void and only a single photon of light carrying the world of Lumen clings to it’s existence. The crumbling world of Lumen is in denial of it’s fate and refuses to give into the void that is heat death. Lightmare follows the story of a nameless daughter of Lumen who goes on a journey through the flickering light of world and guides Lumen through the 5 stages of grief— denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.

                        Lightmare is a 2-player cooperative game with asymmetric gameplay between a desktop PC player and mobile device player.  The desktop player takes on the role of the daughter and handles direct combat and platforming. The mobile player acts as a floating shade to aid the player through indirect combat and environment manipulation. Both players must work together to manipulate light and shadow to navigate the world of Lumen while fending off waves of enemies that oppose them.

                    <p><b>Project Role:</b>  Creative Director</p>

                        <b>Responsibilities:</b> <br>
                        While working on Lightmare I collaborated with an 11 person team as the project’s Creative Director and led the project’s art direction, narrative, and game design through detailed documentation and concept art. This project was a cross-department collaboration between Drexel’s Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & design and Drexel’s College of Computing & Information, therefor it was a critical role of mine to bridge the gaps of communication between students of drastically differing background.  Additionally, I aided playtesting data collection and utilized user feedback to determine what changes were necessary to improve gameplay and player experience.

                    <p>
                        Not only did I lead Lightmare’s design, but I was also heavily involved in asset production. I produced all assets necessary for our two player characters and all enemies featured in Lightmare. I saw Lightmare as an opportunity to explore 2D character animation in depth and used After Effects to setup and animate 2D character rigs. These animations were output as spritesheets and handed over to the programming team for implementation.
